<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?  These elements are to help other developers understand your code more efficiently.  It assits in directing them through your code.  I think that <main> and <nav> are the most helpful.  <main> points to the most important content on the page.
<nav> is important because it concisely defines a set of navigation links.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? The browser renders a page from top to bottom.
